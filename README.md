## I am a big fun of ahud, so I added some features
- Added side menu for quick hud edits (with #base technology)
  - default customizations like scoreboard, chat, medic charge
  - added streamer mode (kind of epic version that just makes letters blank)
  - fix buttons (sound, models)
  - switches for net-graph, transparent ViewModel, sprays
  - extra panel for server moderator/testing
- Added community servers in Play menu
- Added custom binds in options (like null movement, kill bind,...)Added player destruction + robot destruction HUD
- Added two buttons that are active in community servers
- Added back fix for Dashboard Dimmer
- Added monotone colors in status panel
- Added support for [Custom Crosshair](https://github.com/jakadak/ahud-cc/wiki/Crosshair) and [Custom Hitmarker](https://github.com/jakadak/ahud-cc/wiki/Hitmarker) in HudPlayerHealth.res (needs manual editing in code, however I made a pretty cool wiki on my GitHub fork)

Have a lovely day, au revoir!
